Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Introduction of Software Engineering (1968)

The NATO Software Engineering Conference introduced the concept of software engineering in 1968, shifting software development from simple programming to a structured engineering process. This change was driven by the "software crisis," where large projects often faced delays, budget overruns, or failures due to poor planning. The goal was to create organized methods for designing, testing, and maintaining software, making development more reliable and efficient.

2. The Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s - 1980s)

Before structured programming, software was often messy and hard to manage. In the 1970s, Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming, encouraging clear control structures like loops, and conditionals together with modular design. This made code easier to read, debug, and maintain, forming the basis for modern programming practices.

3. The Rise of Agile Development (2001)

The traditional waterfall model was slow and inflexible. In 2001, developers introduced the Agile Manifesto, which promoted flexibility, teamwork, and step-by-step progress. Agile methods like Scrum and Kanban allowed teams to build software in small phases, get feedback quickly, and adjust easily. This approach made software development faster, more efficient, and user-focused, leading to its widespread use today.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning Phase
This is the first stage of software development, where the project’s goals, scope, and expected outcomes are defined. Key people involved in the project are identified, and their roles are assigned. A timeline, budget, and necessary resources are determined. This phase ensures that everyone understands what needs to be done before development begins.

2. Requirements Analysis Phase
In this phase, the team collects and records the software’s requirements from stakeholders to ensure it meets user needs. Both functional (what the software should do) and non-functional (performance, security, etc.) requirements are identified, along with any limitations. The final document from this phase serves as a guide for the rest of the project.

3. Design Phase
Here, a detailed plan for the software’s structure is created. The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are designed, and the system’s components and interactions are defined. The result is a design document that developers use to build the software.

4. Implementation Phase
This is when developers start writing the actual code for the software, using programming languages and tools. They create different parts of the system and combine them into a working application. During this phase, code reviews and initial testing are done to ensure quality.

5. Testing Phase
After coding, the software goes through thorough testing to check for errors or bugs. Different types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are performed. If any issues are found, they are fixed, and additional tests ensure the software is stable before release.

6. Deployment Phase
Once testing is complete, the software is prepared for release. It is installed in the production environment, and final checks are done to ensure everything works properly. Users are trained, and support is provided to help them transition smoothly.

7. Maintenance Phase
After the software is released, it continues to be monitored for any issues. If bugs or problems are reported, they are fixed. Updates and improvements are made as needed, and backups are regularly performed to ensure stability and security.





Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile methodologies each have their unique structure, advantages, and best-use scenarios. 

Waterfall Methodology
The Waterfall approach follows a linear and sequential process, where development moves through clearly defined phases. These typically include planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. One of its key features is that each phase must be fully completed before progressing to the next, leaving little room for changes once a stage is finished. This structured method provides a clear plan and predictable timelines, making project management more straightforward.

One major advantage of Waterfall is its predictability. Because the process is well-documented and follows a strict sequence, teams can accurately estimate costs and timelines. This makes it ideal for projects with fixed requirements and little need for adjustments. Additionally, Waterfall's emphasis on detailed documentation helps maintain records for compliance and future reference.

However, its rigid structure can be a disadvantage. If project requirements change after a phase is completed, making adjustments can be difficult, costly, and time-consuming. As a result, Waterfall is most effective for projects where requirements are well-defined from the start, such as regulatory compliance systems, where thorough documentation and careful planning are essential.

Agile Methodology
On the other hand, Agile is a more flexible and iterative approach that encourages collaboration and customer feedback throughout development. Instead of following a fixed sequence, Agile divides the project into smaller cycles called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Teams work on specific features within each sprint and regularly review progress with stakeholders. The Agile Manifesto, introduced in 2001, emphasizes individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and adaptability.

One of Agile’s greatest strengths is its ability to adjust to changing requirements. The iterative process allows teams to respond quickly to new priorities, ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs. Agile methods, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote continuous communication and teamwork, creating a customer-focused approach with frequent feedback loops.

Another key benefit is Agile's incremental delivery of working software. At the end of each sprint, teams present functional components, which helps identify potential issues early. This reduces the risk of developing software that does not meet user expectations. Agile is particularly suitable for fast-moving industries, such as mobile app development, where market conditions and user preferences frequently change.

Comparison
Waterfall and Agile take very different approaches to software development. Waterfall is structured and sequential, providing clear documentation and stable timelines, making it ideal for projects with fixed requirements. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and adaptable, focusing on continuous improvement and user feedback, making it best for projects with evolving needs.

Conclusion
Both methodologies have their advantages and are suited to different types of projects. Choosing between Waterfall and Agile depends on factors like project complexity, stability of requirements, and need for flexibility.
